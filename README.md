Current Coolify container status:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  STATUS          NAMES
abc123def456   coolify/coolify:latest         "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   Up 8 seconds    coolify
def456abc789   postgres:14-alpine             "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   Up 10 seconds   coolify-db

Restore process completed!

To verify or make manual adjustments, you can connect to the container with:
docker exec -it coolify-db bash
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Default configuration in the script:
```bash
BACKUP_DIR="/data/coolify/backups/coolify/coolify-db-hostdockerinternal"
CONTAINER_NAME="coolify-db"
DB_USER="coolify"
DB_NAME="coolify"
```

Modify these variables in the script if your setup differs from the default Coolify installation.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
```bash
sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername /path/to/script
```

2. **Backup Directory Not Found**
   - Verify the backup directory path
   - Check if backups are stored in a different location

3. **Container Restart Issues**
   - Manually restart containers: `docker restart coolify*`
   - Check container logs: `docker logs coolify-db`
